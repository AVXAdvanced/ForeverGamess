# The Offical ForeverGamess Project

A Semi-Lightweight HTML Game Website with a decent UI and Text that has less than 600 Grammar Issues!
ForeverGames is hosted on Google Sites with the URL: 

Full: https://sites.google.com/view/forevergamess
Short: sites.google.com/view/ForeverGamess

You should enter the short URL into your browser, because modern browsers don't require the full URL with "http://" or "https://" in front. Usually you also don't have to enter "www." but since "sites." replaces "www." you do have to enter it. If you don't you'll end up with google.com again, which will just leave you with issues and a "Site Not Found" error.

As of right now, ForeverGames redirects you to a series of Unblocked Games sites, from where you can then launch your desired game. The Unblocked Games site you are sent to is selected upon which is the most reliable, fast and secure.

I am currently working on a BETA that can launch games itself, and it will (most likely) pull HTML files from here or Replit. I cannot guarantee a release date for that though, but you can expect it sometime in January - Feburary 2025.

ForeverGames is COMPLETELY free and doesn't include any kind of ads. Since hosting the site doesn't cost me any money, that's fine by me.
